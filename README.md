# concert-search

Apps like BandsInTown and Songkick allow you to explore concerts youâ€™re likely to enjoy by searching within a geographic region. With this integration, I wanted to take that location-based search experience in a new direction by combining a map view for a spatial presentation. The result is fast, fun panning and zooming to locate concerts not just in your area, but anywhere around the globe. I used Ionic to quickly build out the app not only as a great mobile and desktop web experience, but also as an installable iOS application.
